- Project Overview
  - This project is a 3D Unity game currently in development by our group. It is a work in progress (WIP), so features, visuals, and mechanics are actively being built and refined. The goal of this project is to explore Unity’s capabilities for creating engaging gameplay, 3D environments, and interactive mechanics.

As development continues, we’ll update this README with new details about the game’s design, features, and progress.
